      <h2><b>Asynchronous and Event Driven-</b></h2>
      <p>
        All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It
        essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to
        return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a
        notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a
        response from the previous API call.
      </p>
      <h2><b>Very Fast-</b></h2>
      <p>
        Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is
        very fast in code execution.
      </p>
      <h2><b>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable-</b></h2>
      <p>
        Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism
        helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server
        highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited
        threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and
        the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests
        than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
